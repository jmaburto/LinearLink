# The Linear-Link model: deriving age-specific death rates from life expectancy
-----------------------------------

`LinearLink` package lets you derive age-specific death rates from a value of life expectancy

To install in R run the following code
`install.packages('devtools')`
`devtools::install_github("mpascariu/LinearLink")`.

Check the examples provided in the `Kannisto` `life.table` and `LinearLink` functions.

For now the model was tested to work for life expectancy at birth. For the other
ages further changes need to be implemented.
